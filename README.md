# Cucumber-Java Sample

This is a simple build script setup for Cucumber using Java.
There is nothing fancy like a webapp or browser testing. All this does is to show you how
to install and run a basic Cucumber test! The purpose is to demonstrate how BDD can be used to test features by defining the outcomes before we write the code.

This example is a single feature file with one scenario. The scenario has three steps, a given, a when and a then. 


## Get the code

Git:

    git clone https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-java-sample.git
    cd cucumber-java-sample



Or simply [download a zip](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-java-sample/archive/master.zip) file.

## Use Maven

Open a command window and run:

    mvn test

This runs Cucumber feature using Cucumber's JUnit runner.
